# 🔎 AWS SolarSystem 🌐 Web API Using 🛢️ DynamoDB

✍️ I have developed a Web API using .NET Core 8, designed to manage Imp, Exp, and Gen Unit logs. This API facilitates operations such as identifying the maximum unit of generation, import, and export values. Additionally, it supports analysis of low unit of generation, import, and export to optimize performance.


# 🛠️ Technology Stack
Detail the programming language and framework (C# and .NET Core 8).


# 🛢️ List cloud services and database (AWS DynamoDB).
Mention additional libraries/packages used

Swashbuckle.AspNetCore – For API documentation and Swagger integration.

AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup – Facilitates AWS service configuration within .NET Core applications.

AWSSDK.DynamoDbv2 – Enables interaction with AWS DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval.

AWSSDK.Core – Provides fundamental AWS SDK components required for seamless AWS integration.

# 🖧 System Architecture
Describe the API structure, including:

Endpoints for handling import/export operations.
Database schema for storing unit logs.
Integration with AWS services.


# ✏️ Implementation Details
Provide an overview of the API development process, including:

How you configured DynamoDB for data persistence.
How unit calculations (max/min generation) work.
The logic behind API requests and responses.


# Include relevant code snippets, screenshots, or database samples.

🎓 This API is developed for educational purposes only.
